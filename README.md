## Survival Classification
Using titanic data to predict whether a passenger will survive. First model drops ID, name, and cabin columns and assess Decision Tree, Random Forrest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting models. Feature importance is examined to improve accuracy in model two. Final model improved accuracy by 1.6-6%
## Decision Tree Model
Using breast cancer data to examine a classification problem: whether a tumor is benign or malignant. Decision Tree model is used and feature importance is examined to improve model accuracy. Final model predicted tumor classification with 91% accuracy.
## Multiple Linear Regression
Using automobile data to predict MPG from features such as cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and year. Examining feature importance and dropping two lowest features. Final model reduced MSE by 11.5%.
## PANDAS DataFrame Manipulation
Practice with dataframe manipulation including adding/deleting/renaming columns, creating boolean values conditional on existing columns, using for loops to generate specified dataframes, and using split functions to separate columns by specified value. Using manipulated dataframe to assess data parameters. 
## Preprocessing Functions
Defining functions (data_preprocessing, feature_extraction) to clean titanic data.
